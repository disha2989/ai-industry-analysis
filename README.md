# AI Industry Analysis Project

## Overview
This project leverages React, D3.js, and JavaScript to create an interactive, data-driven dashboard for exploring trends in artificial intelligence (AI) across various dimensions such as job markets, computational costs, and regional readiness. Advanced visualizations like Zoomable Sunburst Diagrams, Bubble Charts, Heatmaps, Sankey Diagrams, and Drill-Down Charts empower users to derive actionable insights.

## Features
- **Zoomable Sunburst Diagram**: Explore AI trends hierarchically across sectors, costs, and readiness metrics.
- **Bubble Chart**: Visualizes AI computational demands across domains like Language, Vision, and Biology.
- **Heatmap**: Compares region-wise AI readiness metrics (Talent, Infrastructure, Research, etc.).
- **Sankey Diagram**: Illustrates the flow of AI talent and resources across industries and locations.
- **Drill-Down Capabilities**: Clickable visualizations reveal granular insights, such as salary distributions and government strategy details.

## Dataset
The project utilizes multiple datasets:
- **AI Companies Data**: Details contributions by companies in various AI domains.
- **AI Job Market Insights**: Data on salaries, skill requirements, and regional job trends.
- **AI Training Computation Data**: Information on computational demands in diverse AI applications.
- **AI Index Data**: Metrics for regional AI readiness and adoption strategies.

## Installation and Setup
